# Churning Tools

These are going to be a collection of random python files that aid in my churning hobby. They're mostly centered around modern web scraping.

### proxy_url_check.py

Bulk of the program - a multithreaded, proxied web scraper that generates lists of valid and invalid files


### bank_of_america_generator.py

Wrote all possible combinations of a specific BoA URL to a file

### BankOfAmericaFast.cpp

First attempt at BoA url generation, written in C++. Very fast but pretty verbose. Deprecated - use the python version above
